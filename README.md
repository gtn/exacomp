* exabis competencies Block - History *

First official publishing-date: November 2011
exabis competencies was developed with kind support of the Federal Ministry of Education in Austria. 
The goal of this module is to bring competencies that have been developed and provided from an xml-file into Moodle-courses. For this it is important to outline the process of implementation of national educational standards within all school-types in Austria.
In the past years many expert-groups in Austria were given the task of developing competencies that from a student sight can be expressed in form of “I can”-statements (example: “I can develop Excel formulas to solve a mathematical problem”).
These so-called descriptors document the acquisition of competencies (skills) in a certain subject. By this educational standards can be transported across a whole school-type giving teachers as well as students the opportunity to document their work with these competencies.
In addition all expert-groups developed prototypical examples that work with different competencies thus allowing teachers and students to work with these examples to acquire competencies and find orientation on how examples should be made from a teachers’ perspective to fulfill certain educational standards. 
Within the exabis-competencies-block  teachers may associate Moodle assignments with descriptors.
