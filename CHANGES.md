* Subjects with the field "eidtable" from comet can be edited in exacomp, just like subjects that have been created in exacomp only.

The set of presets can be defined in the settings_preconfiguration.xml. This feature works in moodle and dakora for now.
* Moodle activities that have restricted visibility and are related to exacomp competencies now work more coherently with the exacomp examples. If the activity is hidden, the example gets hidden as well, and vice versa. Also, the examples created by relating activities to descriptors that are visible are added to the planning-storage automatically.
